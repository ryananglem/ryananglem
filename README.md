### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working for an amazing live sports streaming company called SolidSport in Stockholm
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swedish and trying to stay on top of react/node/typescript
- ðŸ“« Get in touch with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryananglem/)

Some of the reops in my account need a little bit of love right now, but if you are interested in my work the most up-to-date react/typescript repo is the [coding test](https://github.com/ryananglem/leovegas-movie-search) I did before starting work at LeoVegas
